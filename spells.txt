On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal 4d8 necrotic damage to the target. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the spell’s range, or if the target has total cover from you. Whenever the spell deals damage to a target, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage the target takes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spell Lists.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:sorcerer\">Sorcerer</a>, <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:warlock\">Warlock</a>, <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:wizard\">Wizard</a></p>\n<div class=\"content-separator\" style=\"display: none:\"></div>\n\n\n\n"},{"name":"Erupting Earth","content":"\n\n<div class=\"content-separator\" style=\"display: none:\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything/Elemental Evil Player's Companion</p>\n<p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>\n<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br>\n<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of obsidian)<br>\n<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>\n<p>Choose a point you can see on the ground within range.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: a griffon, a pegasus, a peryton, a dire wolf, a rhinoceros, or a saber—toothed tiger. The creature has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount. The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re—summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed. You can’t have more than one mount bonded by this spell or find steed at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently. Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spell Lists.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:paladin\">Paladin</a></p>\n<div class=\"content-separator\" style=\"display: none:\"></div>\n\n\n\n"}]
